# MANU-AI

MANU-AI is a supervised AI messaging assistant for dietitians. It is designed to help dietitians manage client conversations, draft safe replies, and route clinically sensitive nutrition or health messages to human review.

## Current Status

This repository is a local SaaS/PWA pilot prototype and architecture workspace. It is not a production-connected system yet.

**Latest phase:** Phase 60 audit remediation (2026-06-03). **Production pilot:** `NO-GO` (all eight launch gates open; R-405 open).

**Latest verification:** core tests 104/104, app tests 138/138, `npm run release:verify` passed with only documented R-405 findings.

The current implementation includes:

- A Next.js app prototype in `app/`
- A testable core AI orchestration package in `dietitian-ai-assistant/`
- Supabase schema, RLS, and local persistence work
- Clinical safety routing for green, yellow, and red messages
- Yellow-risk draft approval and hold behavior
- Red-risk manual handoff and reactivation lock behavior
- Dietitian-controlled client conversation language
- Documentation and evidence plans in `docs/`
- Phase 59 architecture review remediation and Phase 60 audit follow-up hardening

## Safety Model

MANU-AI is built around supervised clinical safety boundaries:

- Green messages may be handled automatically only when AI is active and the client is in autopilot mode.
- Yellow messages create dietitian approval drafts and pause AI for that client until reviewed.
- Red messages do not call an LLM and require human handoff.
- Personas affect communication style only, not clinical safety rules.
- Production launch gates remain open until external approval artifacts are supplied.

## Repository Structure

```text
app/                       Next.js SaaS/PWA prototype
dietitian-ai-assistant/    Core orchestration and safety package
docs/                      Specs, risk register, launch-gate evidence
PLAN.md                    Canonical project plan
PROJECT_PLAN.md            Long-form roadmap
HANDOFF_FOR_NEXT_CODEX.md  Continuation notes for future Codex sessions
```

## Local Verification

Common checks:

```powershell
cd app
npm test
npm run lint
npm run release:verify
```

Core package tests:

```powershell
cd dietitian-ai-assistant
npm test
```

Local Supabase/RLS evidence requires Docker Desktop and local Supabase.

## Important Boundaries

By default, work in this repository uses local/mock flows. Real WhatsApp, Telegram, Gemini/external LLM, monitoring, secret manager, and real health-data integrations should only be started as explicit integration phases with scope, rollback, test, and approval plans.

R-405 dependency remediation must follow the documented Phase 22 procedure.
